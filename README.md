# bAInelm2

This is the second version of bAInaryglobe's attempt at Artificial intelligence, this time, building a ready-made chatbot that simply takes string input, and prints string output


## input/output

We project for bAInelm to be able to accept string inputs in several means:

1. cli argument
2. http requests
3. web interface

For now, we are pioneering the cli argument, pending when this project receives more attention. Otherwise, we are simply developing this as a foundational stepping stone into our AI that could later be used in several more of our products.

We believe in open-source so much, because it has brought us this far


## conclusion

bAInelm2 is an open source foundational chatbot, written exclusively in c, self training, and completely offline. Feel free to contribute.
